The type <code>T</code> should usually be the type of elements of the coefficient ring of the power series ring. For example, in the case of <span>$\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$</span> the type <code>T</code> would be the type of an integer, e.g. <code>BigInt</code>.</p><p>Within the <code>SeriesElem{T}</code> abstract type is the abstract type <code>RelSeriesElem{T}</code> for relative power series, and <code>AbsSeriesElem{T}</code> for absolute power series.</p><p>Relative series are typically stored with a valuation and a series that is either zero or that has nonzero constant term. Absolute series are stored starting from the constant term, even if it is zero.</p><p>If the parent object for a relative series ring over the bignum integers has type <code>MySeriesRing</code> and series in that ring have type <code>MySeries</code> then one would have:</p><ul><li><p><code>MySeriesRing &lt;: SeriesRing{BigInt}</code></p></li><li><p><code>MySeries &lt;: RelSeriesElem{BigInt}</code></p></li></ul><p>Series rings should be made unique on the system by caching parent objects (unless an optional <code>cache</code> parameter is set to <code>false</code>). Series rings should at least be distinguished based on their base (coefficient) ring. But if they have the same base ring and symbol (for their variable/generator) and same default precision, they should certainly have the same parent object.</p><p>See <code>src/generic/GenericTypes.jl</code> for an example of how to implement such a cache (which usually makes use of a dictionary).</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Required-functionality-for-series-1" href="#Required-functionality-for-series-1">Required functionality for series</a></h2><p>In addition to the required functionality for the Ring interface the Series Ring interface has the following required functions.</p><p>We suppose that <code>R</code> is a fictitious base ring (coefficient ring) and that <code>S</code> is a series ring over <code>R</code> (e.g. <span>$S = R[[x]]$</span>) with parent object <code>S</code> of type <code>MySeriesRing{T}</code>. We also assume the series in the ring have type <code>MySeries{T}</code>, where  <code>T</code> is the type of elements of the base (coefficient) ring.</p><p>Of course, in practice these types may not be parameterised, but we use parameterised types here to make the interface clearer.</p><p>Note that the type <code>T</code> must (transitively) belong to the abstract type <code>RingElem</code>.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Constructors-1" href="#Constructors-1">Constructors</a></h3><p>In addition to the standard constructors, the following constructors, taking an array of coefficients, must be available.</p><p>For relative power series and Laurent series we have:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">(S::MySeriesRing{T})(A::Array{T, 1}, len::Int, prec::Int, val::Int) where T &lt;: AbstractAlgebra.RingElem</code></pre><p>Create the series in the given ring whose valuation is <code>val</code>, whose absolute precision is given by <code>prec</code> and the coefficients of which are given by <code>A</code>, starting from the first nonzero term.
