Various parts of Nemo are licensed differently. 

As Nemo links dynamically at runtime with various libraries all of whose licenses are compatible with GPL v3+, you may safely distribute Nemo *as a whole* under the terms of that license (see the MPFR or MPIR source trees downloaded as part of the Nemo package installation for copies of this license, or refer to it online here:

* The MPIR and MPFR libraries are licensed LGPL v3+. The license texts are distributed with the libraries, which are downloaded as part of the Nemo package installation.

* The flint library is licensed GPL v2+. The license text is supplied with the library, which is downloaded as part of the Nemo package installation.

* The file ZZ.jl is licensed with the MIT license (see ZZ.jl for precise conditions of the license).

* The individual .jl files (other than ZZ.jl) in the Nemo.jl package are licensed under the Simplified "2-clause" BSD License:
