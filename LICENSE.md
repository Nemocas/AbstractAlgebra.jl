As AbstractAlgebra links dynamically at runtime with various libraries included with Julia, all of whose licenses are compatible with GPL v3+, you may safely distribute AbstractAlgebra *as a whole* under the terms of that license. See for example the MPFR or GMP licenses in the Julia distribution, or refer to the GPL online here:
