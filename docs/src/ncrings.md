# Noncommutative ring Interface

AbstractAlgebra.jl generic code makes use of a standardised set of functions which it
expects to be implemented for all noncommutative rings. Here we document this interface.

All libraries which want to make use of the generic capabilities of AbstractAlgebra.jl
must supply all of the required functionality for their noncommutative rings.

## Types

Most noncommutative rings must supply two types:
  - a type for the parent object (representing the ring itself)
  - a type for elements of that ring

The parent type must belong to `AbstractAlgebra.NCRing` and the element type must belong
to `AbstractAlgebra.NCRingElem`. Of course, the types may belong to these abstract types
transitively via an intermediate abstract type.

For parameterised rings, we advise that the types of both the parent objects and
element objects to be parameterised by the types of the elements of the base ring
(see the function `base_ring` below for a definition).

There can be variations on this theme: e.g. in some areas of mathematics there is a
notion of a coefficient domain, in which case it may make sense to parameterise all
types by the type of elements of this coefficient domain. But note that this may have
implications for the ad hoc operators one might like to explicitly implement.

## Parent object caches

In many cases, it is desirable to have only one object in the system to represent each
ring. This means that if the same ring is constructed twice, elements of the two rings
will be compatible as far as arithmetic is concerned.

In order to facilitate this, global caches of rings are stored in AbstractAlgebra.jl,
usually implemented using dictionaries. For example, the `Generic.PolyRing` parent
objects are looked up in a dictionary `PolyID` to see if they have been previously
defined.

Whether these global caches are provided or not, depends on both mathematical and
algorithmic considerations. E.g. in the case of number fields, it isn't desirable to
identify all number fields with the same defining polynomial, as they may be considered
with distinct embeddings into one another. In other cases, identifying whether two rings
are the same may be prohibitively expensive. Generally, it may only make sense
algorithmically to identify two rings if they were constructed from identical data.

If a global cache is provided, it must be optionally possible to construct the parent
objects without caching. This is done by passing a boolean value `cached` to the inner
constructor of the parent object. See generic/GenericTypes.jl` for examples of how to
construct and handle such caches.

## Required functions for all rings

In the following, we list all the functions that are required to be provided for
noncommutative rings in AbstractAlgebra.jl or by external libraries wanting to use
AbstractAlgebra.jl.

We give this interface for fictitious types `MyParent` for the type of the ring parent
object `R` and `MyElem` for the type of the elements of the ring.

Note that generic functions in AbstractAlgebra.jl may not rely on the existence of
functions that are not documented here. If they do, those functions will only be
available for rings that implement that additional functionality, and should be
documented as such.

### Data type and parent object methods

```julia
parent_type(::Type{MyElem})
```

Return the type of the corresponding parent object for the given element type. For
example, `parent_type(Generic.Poly{T})` will return `Generic.PolyRing{T}`.

```julia
elem_type(::Type{MyParent})
```

Return the type of the elements of the ring whose parent object has the given type.
This is the inverse of the `parent_type` function, i.e. `elem_type(Generic.PolyRing{T})`
will return `Generic.Poly{T}`.

```julia
base_ring(R::MyParent)
```

Given a parent object `R`, representing a ring, this function returns the parent object
of any base ring that parameterises this ring.

If the ring is not parameterised by another ring, this function must return `Union{}`.

```julia
parent(f::MyElem)
```

Return the parent object of the given element, i.e. return the ring to which the given
element belongs.

This is usually stored in a field `parent` in each ring element. (If the parent objects
have `mutable struct` types, the internal overhead here is just an additional machine
pointer stored in each element of the ring.)

For some element types it isn't necessary to append the parent object as a field of
every element. This is the case when the parent object can be reconstructed just given
the type of the elements. For example, this is the case for the ring of integers and
in fact for any ring element type that isn't parameterised or generic in any way.

```julia
isexact_type(::Type{MyElem})
```

Return `true` if every element of the given type is represented exactly.

Note that `MyElem` may be parameterised or an abstract type, in which case every
element of every type represented by `MyElem` must be exact, otherwise the function
must return `false`.

```julia
Base.hash(f::MyElem, h::UInt)
```

Return a hash for the object $f$ of type `UInt`. This is used as a hopefully cheap way
to distinguish objects that differ arithmetically.

If the object has components, e.g. the coefficients of a polynomial or elements of a
matrix, these should be hashed recursively, passing the same parameter `h` to all
levels. Each component should then be xor'd with `h` before combining the individual
component hashes to give the final hash.

The hash functions in AbstractAlgebra.jl usually start from some fixed 64 bit
hexadecimal  value that has been picked at random by the library author for that type.
That is then truncated to fit a `UInt` (in case the latter is not 64 bits). This ensures
that objects that are the same arithmetically (or that have the same components), but
have different types (or structures), are unlikely to hash to the same value.

```julia
deepcopy_internal(f::MyElem, dict::ObjectIdDict)
```

Return a copy of the given element, recursively copying all components of the object.

Obviously the parent, if it is stored in the element, should not be copied. The new
element should have precisely the same parent as the old object.

For types that cannot self-reference themselves anywhere internally, the `dict` argument
may be ignored.

In the case that internal self-references are possible, please consult the Julia
documentation on how to implement `deepcopy_internal`.

### Constructors

Outer constructors for most AbstractAlgebra types are provided by overloading the call
syntax for parent objects.

If `R` is a parent object for a given ring we provide the following constructors.

```julia
(R::MyParent)()
```

Return the zero object of the given ring.

```julia
(R::MyParent)(a::Integer)
```

Coerce the given integer into the given ring.

```julia
(R::MyParent)(a::MyElem)
```

If $a$ belongs to the given ring, the function returns it (without making a copy).
Otherwise an error is thrown.

For parameterised rings we also require a function to coerce from the base ring into
the parent ring.

```julia
(R::MyParent{T})(a::T) where T <: AbstractAlgebra.RingElem
```

Coerce $a$ into the ring $R$ if $a$ belongs to the base ring of $R$.

### Basic manipulation of rings and elements

```julia
zero(R::MyParent)
```

Return the zero element of the given ring.

```julia
one(R::MyParent)
```

Return the multiplicative identity of the given ring.

```julia
iszero(f::MyElem)
```

Return `true` if the given element is the zero element of the ring it belongs to.

```julia
isone(f::MyElem)
```

Return `true` if the given element is the multiplicative identity of the ring it belongs
to.

### String I/O

```julia
show(io::IO, R::MyParent)
```

This should print (to the given IO object), an English description of the parent ring.
If the ring is parameterised, it can call the corresponding `show` function for any
rings it depends on.

```julia
show(io::IO, f::MyElem)
```

This should print a human readable, textual representation of the object (to the given
IO object). It can recursively call the corresponding `show` functions for any of its
components.

It may be necessary in some cases to print parentheses around components of $f$ or to
print signs of components. For these, the following functions will exist for each
component or component type.

```julia
needs_parentheses(f::MyElem)
```

Should returns `true` if parentheses are needed around this object when printed, e.g. as
a coefficient of a polynomial. As an example, non-constant polynomials would need such
parentheses if used as coefficients of another polynomial.

```julia
displayed_with_minus_in_front(f::MyElem)
```

When printing polynomials, a `+` sign is usually inserted automatically between terms of
the polynomial. However, this is not desirable if the coefficient is negative and that
negative sign is already printed when the coefficient is printed.

This function must return `true` if $f$ is printed starting with a negative sign.
This suppresses the automatic printing of a `+` sign by polynomial printing
functions that are printing $f$ as a coefficient of a term.

Note that if `needs_parentheses` returns `true` for $f$, then `displayed_with_minus_in_front` should always
return `false` for that $f$, since an automatic `+` will need to be printed in front of
a coefficient that is printed with parentheses.

```julia
show_minus_one(::Type{MyElem})
```

When printing polynomials, we prefer to print $x$ rather than $1*x$ if the degree $1$
term has coefficient $1$. This can be taken care of without any special support.

However, we also prefer to print $-x$ rather than $-1*x$. This requires special support,
since $-1$ in some rings is not printed as $-1$ (e.g. $-1$ in $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$
might be printed as $2$). In such rings, `show_minus_one` should return `true`.

If `show_minus_one` returns true, polynomial printing functions will not print $-x$ for
terms of degree $1$ with coefficient $-1$, but will use the printing function of the
given type to print the coefficient in that case.

### Unary operations

```julia
-(f::MyElem)
```

Return $-f$.

### Binary operations

```julia
+(f::MyElem, g::MyElem)
-(f::MyElem, g::MyElem)
*(f::MyElem, g::MyElem)
```

Return $f + g$, $f - g$ or $fg$, respectively.

### Comparison

```
==(f::MyElem, g::MyElem)
```

Return `true` if $f$ and $g$ are arithmetically equal. In the case where the two
elements are inexact, the function returns `true` if they agree to the minimum precision
of the two.

```
isequal(f::MyElem, g::MyElem)
```

For exact rings, this should return the same thing as `==` above. For inexact rings,
this returns `true` only if the two elements are arithmetically equal and have the same
precision.

### Powering

```julia
^(f::MyElem, e::Int)
```

Return $f^e$. The function should throw a `DomainError()` if negative exponents don't
make sense but are passed to the function.

### Exact division

```julia
divexact_left(f::MyElem, g::MyElem)
divexact_right(f::MyElem, g::MyElem)
```

If $f = ga$ for some $a$ in the ring, the function `divexact_left(f, g)` returns `a`. If
$f = ag$ then `divexact_right(f, g)` returns `a`. A `DivideError()` should be thrown
if division is by zero. If no exact quotient exists or an impossible inverse is
unavoidably encountered, an error should be thrown.

### Unsafe operators

To speed up arithmetic of objects built over a given ring, it sometimes makes sense to
mutate values in place rather than replace them with a newly created object every time
they are modified.

For this purpose, certain mutating operators are required. In order to support immutable
types (struct in Julia) and systems that don't have in-place operators, all unsafe
operators must return the (ostensibly) mutated value. Only the returned value is used
in computations, so this lifts the requirement that the unsafe operators actually
mutate the value.

Note the exclamation point is a convention, which indicates that the object may be
mutated in-place.

To make use of these functions, one must be certain that no other references are held
to the object being mutated, otherwise those values will also be changed!

The results of `deepcopy` and all arithmetic operations, including powering and division
can be assumed to be new objects without other references being held, as can objects
returned from constructors.

Note that `R(a)` where `R` is the ring `a` belongs to, does not create a new value. For
this case, use `deepcopy(a)`.

```julia
zero!(f::MyElem)
```

Set the value $f$ to zero in place. Return the mutated value.

```julia
mul!(c::MyElem, a::MyElem, b::MyElem)
```

Set $c$ to the value $ab$ in place. Return the mutated value. Aliasing is permitted.

```julia
add!(c::MyElem, a::MyElem, b::MyElem)
```

Set $c$ to the value $a + b$ in place. Return the mutated value. Aliasing is permitted.

```julia
addeq!(a::MyElem, b::MyElem)
```

Set $a$ to $a + b$ in place. Return the mutated value. Aliasing is permitted.

### Random generation

The random functions are only used for test code to generate test data. They therefore
don't need to provide any guarantees on uniformity, and in fact, test values that are
known to be a good source of corner cases can be supplied.

```julia
rand(R::MyParent, v...)
```

Return a random element in the given ring of the specified size.

There can be as many arguments as is necessary to specify the size of the test example
which is being produced.

### Promotion rules

In order for AbstractAlgebra to be able to automatically coerce up towers of rings,
certain promotion rules must be defined. For every ring, one wants to be able to coerce
integers into the ring. And for any ring constructed over a base ring, one would like to
be able to coerce from the base ring into the ring.

The promotion rules look a bit different depending on whether the element type is
parameterised or not and whether it is built on a base ring.

For ring element types `MyElem` that are neither parameterised nor built over a base
ring, the promotion rules can be defined as follows:

```julia
promote_rule(::Type{MyElem}, ::Type{T}) where {T <: Integer} = MyElem
```

For ring element types `MyType` that aren't parameterised, but which have a base ring
with concrete element type `T` the promotion rules can be defined as follows:

```julia
promote_rule(::Type{MyElem}, ::Type{U}) where U <: Integer = MyElem
```

```julia
promote_rule(::Type{MyElem}, ::Type{T}) = MyElem
```

For ring element types `MyElem{T}` that are parameterised by the type of elements of
the base ring, the promotion rules can be defined as follows:

```julia
promote_rule(::Type{MyElem{T}}, ::Type{MyElem{T}}) where T <: RingElement = MyElem{T}
```

```julia
function promote_rule(::Type{MyElem{T}}, ::Type{U}) where {T <: RingElement, U <: RingEle
ment}
   promote_rule(T, U) == T ? MyElem{T} : Union{}
end
```

## Required functionality for inexact rings

### Approximation (floating point and ball arithmetic only)

```julia
isapprox(f::MyElem, g::MyElem; atol::Real=sqrt(eps()))
```

This is used by test code that uses rings involving floating point or ball arithmetic.
The function should return `true` if all components of $f$ and $g$ are equal to
within the square root of the Julia epsilon, since numerical noise may make an exact
comparison impossible.

For parameterised rings over an inexact ring, we also require the following ad hoc
approximation functionality.

```julia
isapprox(f::MyElem{T}, g::T; atol::Real=sqrt(eps())) where T <: AbstractAlgebra.RingElem
```

```julia
isapprox(f::T, g::MyElem{T}; atol::Real=sqrt(eps())) where T <: AbstractAlgebra.RingElem
```

These notionally coerce the element of the base ring into the parameterised ring and do
a full comparison.

## Optional functionality

Some functionality is difficult or impossible to implement for all rings in the system.
If it is provided, additional functionality or performance may become available. Here
is a list of all functions that are considered optional and can't be relied on by
generic functions in the AbstractAlgebra Ring interface.

It may be that no algorithm, or no efficient algorithm is known to implement these
functions. As these functions are optional, they do not need to exist. Julia will
already inform the user that the function has not been implemented if it is called but
doesn't exist.

### Optional basic manipulation functionality

```julia
isunit(f::MyElem)
```

Return `true` if the given element is a unit in the ring it belongs to.

```
characteristic(R::MyParent)
```

Return the characteristic of the ring $R$ or $-1$ if this is unknown or cannot
be computed efficiently. Defining this function may speed up some code paths,
as more efficient algorithms exist for certain characteristics but are invalid
for others.

### Optional binary ad hoc operators

By default, ad hoc operations are handled by AbstractAlgebra.jl if they are not defined
explicitly, by coercing both operands into the same ring and then performing the
required operation.

In some cases, e.g. for matrices, this leads to very inefficient behaviour. In such
cases, it is advised to implement some of these operators explicitly.

It can occasionally be worth adding a separate set of ad hoc binary operators for the
type `Int`, if this can be done more efficiently than for arbitrary Julia Integer types.

```julia
+(f::MyElem, c::Integer)
-(f::MyElem, c::Integer)
*(f::MyElem, c::Integer)
```

```julia
+(c::Integer, f::MyElem)
-(c::Integer, f::MyElem)
*(c::Integer, f::MyElem)
```

For parameterised types, it is also sometimes more performant to provide explicit ad
hoc operators with elements of the base ring.

```julia
+(f::MyElem{T}, c::T) where T <: AbstractAlgebra.RingElem
-(f::MyElem{T}, c::T) where T <: AbstractAlgebra.RingElem
*(f::MyElem{T}, c::T) where T <: AbstractAlgebra.RingElem
```

```julia
+(c::T, f::MyElem{T}) where T <: AbstractAlgebra.RingElem
-(c::T, f::MyElem{T}) where T <: AbstractAlgebra.RingElem
*(c::T, f::MyElem{T}) where T <: AbstractAlgebra.RingElem
```

### Optional ad hoc comparisons

```julia
==(f::MyElem, c::Integer)
```

```julia
==(c::Integer, f::MyElem)
```

```julia
==(f::MyElem{T}, c:T) where T <: AbstractAlgebra.RingElem
```

```julia
==(c::T, f::MyElem{T}) where T <: AbstractAlgebra.RingElem
```

### Optional powering functions

```julia
^(f::MyElem, e::BigInt)
```

In case $f$ cannot explode in size when powered by a very large integer, and it is
practical to do so, one may provide this function to support powering with `BigInt`
exponents (or for external modules, any other big integer type).

### Optional unsafe operators

```julia
addmul!(c::MyElem, a::MyElem, b::MyElem, t::MyElem)
```

Set $c = c + ab$ in-place. Return the mutated value. The value $t$ should be a temporary
of the same type as $a$, $b$ and $c$, which can be used arbitrarily by the
implementation to speed up the computation. Aliasing between $a$, $b$ and $c$ is
permitted.
